# ❓ AIPL – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
## General Overview
### 🧠 1. What is the AIPL?
The Anti Intellectual Property License (AIPL) is a radical copyleft license designed to maximize freedom. It permits unrestricted use, copying, modification, and distribution of a work — including commercial use — without requiring attribution. The only condition: derivative works must remain equally free under the same or an equivalent license.

## Usage Rights and Restrictions
### 🚀 2. What can I do with an AIPL-licensed work?
You are free to:

- Use the work for any purpose, including commercial
- Copy, share, and redistribute it
- Modify, remix, transform, or even destroy it
- Sell it or incorporate it into other projects
- Important: Any derivative work must be licensed under AIPL or a license with equivalent terms.

### 🚫 3. What am I not allowed to do?
You may not re-license the work under a more restrictive license. The copyleft condition must be preserved in all derivative works. Beyond that, there are no limitations.

### 🏷️ 4. Is attribution required?
No. Attribution is entirely optional. You may credit the original author if you wish, but it is never mandatory.

## License Principles
### (ↄ) 5. What does “copyleft” mean in this context?
Copyleft under AIPL means that if you share modified versions of the work, they must be released under the same license (AIPL) or one with equivalent freedoms. This is similar to the “Share-Alike” clause in Creative Commons licenses, but without the attribution requirement.

### 🎨 6. Can I license my own work under AIPL?
Absolutely. To apply AIPL to your work, include the following statement in your project:

> This work is licensed under the Anti Intellectual Property License (AIPL). You may freely use, distribute, and modify it for any purpose, provided that any derivative works remain under the same license or one with equivalent terms. No attribution required. No warranty.

Alternatively, you may use a short form:

> 🄯 <year> – Licensed under AIPL (https://github.com/aipl-author/AIPL)

Comparison with Other Licenses
### ✒ 7. Why not use CC0, WTFPL, or Unlicense?
These licenses effectively place works in the public domain, allowing unrestricted use. However, they lack a copyleft clause, meaning derivative works can be re-licensed restrictively. AIPL ensures both the original and all future versions remain free.

### ✒ 8. Why not use CC BY-SA or GNU GPL?
While these licenses enforce copyleft, they also require attribution. AIPL takes a more radical approach by removing the attribution requirement entirely. True copyleft, in this view, should not depend on naming the author.

## Legal Considerations
### 🧩 9. What types of works can be licensed under AIPL?
Any work that is eligible for copyright or intellectual property protection in your jurisdiction, including:

- Software
- Written content
- Music and audio
- Visual art and video
- Databases
- Inventions
- and more

### ⚖️ 10. Is AIPL legally valid?
In most jurisdictions: yes. AIPL functions as a waiver of copyright and a license granting maximum legal freedom, backed by a copyleft clause. If licenses like CC BY-SA, GPL, CC0, or Unlicense are enforceable in your country, AIPL should be too.

### 🔗 11. Is AIPL compatible with Creative Commons or GPL?
Not directly. AIPL is more permissive in some areas (e.g., attribution) and stricter in others (e.g., copyleft scope). Compatibility must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

### 🔒 12. Can someone re-license my work under a restrictive license?
No. That would violate AIPL’s core copyleft requirement. The freedoms granted by AIPL must remain intact.

## Additional Questions
### 💰 13. Can others sell my work?
Yes. Commercial use is explicitly permitted. Others may sell or redistribute your work — including modified versions — as long as they remain under AIPL or an equivalent license.

### 📝 14. Do I have to be credited?
No. Attribution is not required, though it is allowed and encouraged.

### 🛠️ 15. Can people modify my work?
Yes. Anyone may modify your work without restriction, provided the modified version is licensed under AIPL or a license with equivalent terms.

### 🌱 16. Can I contribute to the AIPL project?
Yes. Contributions are welcome via GitHub issues or pull requests. Suggestions to improve the legal clarity, enforceability, or usability of the license and its documentation are encouraged.
