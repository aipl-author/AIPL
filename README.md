Anti Intellectual Property License - a radical copyleft license


# ❓ AIPL - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### 🧠 1 What is AIPL?
The Anti Intellectual Property License (AIPL) is a radical copyleft license. It allows anyone to use, copy, modify, and distribute a work without restrictions, and without attribution — as long as derivative works remain equally free.

---
### 🚀 2 What can I do with an AIPL-licensed work?
Everything. You may freely:
- Use it for any purpose (including commercial)
- Copy and share it
- Modify it, remix it, destroy it, sell it
- And so on.
But it is important that any derivative works remain under the same (AIPL) or an equivalent license

---

### 🚫 3 What am I not allowed to do?
You may not re-license the work under a restrictive license. Derivative works must inherit the copyleft condition. That’s it, everything else is fine.

---
### 🏷️ 4 What about attribution?

You don’t have to name the author. If you want to — you may. Attribution is optional, never mandatory.

---
### (ↄ) 5 What does “copyleft” mean in this context?
If you share modified versions of the work, you **must** release them under the same license (AIPL) or one with equivalent freedoms and conditions. It is analogous to the SA (Share-Alike) condition in the Creative Commons licenses: Derivative works must inherit the same license.

---
### 🎨 6 Can I use AIPL for my own work?
Yes, you can. By licensing your work under AIPL it stays free. Just copy the license text into your project by clearly stating:

>This work is licensed under the Anti Intellectual Property License (AIPL). You may freely use, distribute and modify it for any purpose, as long as any derivative works remain under the same license or under a license of equivalent terms. No attribution required. No warranty. For more information see: https://github.com/aipl-author/AIPL/

Or use a short form like: 
>Copyleft 🄯 (<year\>): Licensed under AIPL (https://github.com/aipl-author/AIPL/)

(or similar or more official formats)

### ✒7 Why not use CC0, WTFPL, Unlicense, etc.?
It is true that these licenses release a given work into public domain, such that it is free to use. However, they are not copyleft, meaning derivative works might be subject to future copyright claims. AIPL ensures the freedom of the work **and of its future forms.**

---

### ✒ 8 Why not use CC BY-SA, GNU GPL etc.?
AIPL is much more radical permissive than the traditional copyleft licenses beacause it does not require the attribution of the creator(s). Of course attribution may be strongly encouraged but to be consistent a real copyleft license should reject mandatory attribution.

---

### 🧩 9 What kinds of works can I license under AIPL?

**Any kind of work** your jurisdiction allows and grants property claims. This includes software, written text, music, images, videos, databases, inventions and more.

---
### ⚖️ 10 Is AIPL legally valid?
In most jurisdictions: **yes, as far as current law allows**.  
The AIPL explicitly waives all copyright and related rights and functions as a license to grant maximum legal freedom, backed by a copyleft clause. If general copyleft licenses (like CC BY-SA or GPL) and permissive licenses (like CC0, WTFPL, Unlicense) work in your country, then AIPL should bind too.

### 🔗 11 Is AIPL compatible with Creative Commons or GPL?

No – AIPL is more permissive in some areas (e.g. attribution), but more strict in others (copyleft scope). Compatibility must be evaluated case-by-case.

---

### 🔒 12 Can someone re-license my work under a more restrictive license?

**No.** That violates AIPL’s core copyleft requirement. No one can close or restrict the freedoms you granted.

---
### 13 💰 Can others sell my work?

Yes. AIPL explicitly allows commercial use. Anyone can sell or redistribute your work, including derivatives – but **only under the same license or an equivalent one**.

---

### 14 📝 Do I have to be credited?

No. Attribution is **not required**, although it's permitted and encouraged.

---

### 15 🛠️ Can people modify my work?

Yes, without restriction – as long as their modified version stays under AIPL or a fully equivalent license.

---

### 🌱 16 Can I contribute to the AIPL Project
Yes. If you open an issue or pull request we can discuss your recommended changes. Feel free to improve the Anti Intellectual Property License to make it more legally binding, clear and functional or improve the FAQ!
