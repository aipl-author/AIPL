# Anti Intellectual Property License

## Overview
The Anti Intellectual Property License (AIPL) is an international public and radically free copyleft license designed to enable the complete relinquishment of nearly all copyright and related intellectual property rights in any given work, while simultaneously preventing proprietary appropriation of any derivative work or distribution of the work. This license is free, requires no attribution, and mandates share-alike distribution under identical or equivalent terms.

This document constitutes the official full legal text of the AIPL, defining the conditions under which the licensed work may be used, modified, and distributed.

The following table summarizes the key features of the AIPL:

|                                                               | Free / Permitted            | Mandatory | Prohibited |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Use (including commercial)                                    | ✔                           |           |            |
| Distribution (including verbatim and modified copies)         | ✔                           |           |            |
| Modification / Adaption (including partial modifications)     | ✔                           |           |            |
| Attribution                                                   | ✔ (no attribution required) |           |            |
| ShareAlike (AIPL or a license of equivalent terms) / Copyleft |                             | ✔         |            |
The license may be attached to the given work by naming the license, providing the full license document, or a link to the license text. The license text holds primacy over the copyright notice or any other descriptive statement, referring to the license. 

## License
**Under *condition* $X$, a license with attributes $Y$ is hereby granted to do $Z$ to or with the *Work*, with disclaimer and scope $\alpha$.**

$X$: ***Every Copy and Derivative Work is licensed under equivalent terms***, that is the license of the Copy / Derivative Work permits $Z$, under condition $X$. In other words, the license of the Copy / Derivative Work has the following properties (all of the following):
1. Total Freedom (i.e. $Z$), 
2. No attribution requirement (for the avoidance of any doubt)
3. Share-Alike / Copyleft (i.e. $X$)
4. Irrevocability, Internationality, Perpetuality, Royalty-Freedom (i.e essential parts of $Y$)

$Y$: (all of the following)
1. **worldwide / international,** 
2. **irrevocable,**
3. **royalty-free,**
4. **public,**
5. **free,**
6. **non-exclusive,**
7. ***everlasting / perpetual***

$Z$: ***Any (lawful) action***. Examples (including but not limited to): (any of the following)
1. use, perform, run, study (privatly, publicly, commercial or any other manner or purpose)
2. share, copy, distribute (verbatim or edited or any other manner)
3. modify, adapt, translate, remix, exerpt from, derive from, integrate into, (full, in parts, by inspiration or in any other manner)
4. in every medium or form (past, present, future, hypothetical or any other manner)

$\alpha$:
1. **Scope**: Every condition ($X$), attribute ($Y$), right to use ($Z$) applies (only) to the fullest extent and/or longest timespan permitted by and possible under current positive law. Limitations imposed by law cannot be altered.
2. **Disclaimer**: No warranties are given, everything is provided "as is".




## Adnotations and Definitions - for the avoidance of any doubt
- **condition**: means if and only if (iff.). Explanation: Iff. the condition explained as X is fulfilled, the license is granted. In any case the condition is not fulfilled the license is immediatly (or as soon as possible) revoked or was never granted. In other words, it is unvalid to do $Z$ to the Work, if $X$ is violated.
- **Work**: is the licensed material. Explanation: It may be anything to which intellectual property grants or copyright are granted by applicable law. The licence applies (only) to the material it is applied to. This may include but is not limited to: text, images (paintings, photographs, etc.), music (composition, performanace), software, artworks, patents, etc.
- **Copy / Derivative Work**: is the result of doing $Z$ to the Work, especially  which applicable law would also grant a copyright (or other intellectual property right) to. 
- **X**: To apply this same License (AIPL) to the Copy / Derivative Work is a **valid** license fullfilling the condition $X$. This is the comparativly easiest method to fulfill $X$, in order to do $Z$.
- **everlasting / perpetual** (see also scope $\alpha$) The license applies to the longest extent possible under law.
- **any (lawful) action**: In no way does this license endorse or enable any act that is illegal per se, but is only completely permissive regarding all restrictions imposable or otherwise reserved by intellectual property grants or copyright.
